            <p>Ready to transform your domain modeling?</p>
            <p>In this hands-on workshop, you'll discover how
                <i>event sourcing</i>
                shifts focus from stale states to
                <b>immutable facts</b>—the
                                    true atoms of your domain. Learn how to combine
                <i>business capability discovery</i>
                with
                <i>event sourcing</i>
                and the
                <i>decider
                                    pattern</i>
                to create thinner, verb-oriented aggregates that speak pure business language.</p>
            <p>Through practical exercises, you'll see how storing events lets you reinterpret your domain as business rules evolve,
                without painful migrations.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Stop fighting your domain model—join the workshop to embrace events and build more maintainable,
                    business-aligned architectures!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We will start the workshop with an existing codebase that was designed around nouns. Our ultimate goal is to
                understand why we need to modernize the current architecture and how to transform the models into a set of related
                behaviors and processes with clearly defined boundaries.</p>
            <p>All examples will be written in
                <em>NodeJS</em>.</p>
