<h1>Welcome to <span class="brand">Know-How Code</span> by Artur Wojnar!</h1>

<img src="/public/logo.svg" class="logo-about light-img" />

<p>I'm Artur Wojnar and this is my blog I called <i>Know-How Code</i>.</p>

<p>Why that name? I realised that the <i>know-how</i> is a toolset we build over years, and this is what can distinguish us from competitors. The <i>know-how</i> is the ability to solve non-trivial and complex issues by providing knowledge, experience and worked-out solutions, either third parties or your own.</p>

<img src="/public/arturwojnar-profile.png" class="profile-about" />

<p>I have been working in the industry since 2011. Nowadays, I work as a hands-on Solutions Architect and consultant helping other teams.</p>
<p>I collaboratively design products with clients. I treat the programming as a side effect of that design.</p>

<p>My goal here, on this blog, is to embed this thought. I want to show you that <b>most of the concepts in our industry can be simplified to risk and coupling management with a hefty dose of communication</b>. I want to show you how the <b>design phase is crucial</b>, and if you don't think about the design, you will end up with ad-hoc architecture.</p>
