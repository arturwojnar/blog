I changed my mind after years of mentally not supporting TypeScript ðŸ˜ˆ  

When I first interacted with this wrapper 10-12 years ago, I felt that **true JavaScript** believers should use JavaScript and not pretend that JavaScript is not prototype-based. Instead, they play with interfaces ðŸ¤¢ and classical inheritance ðŸ¤¢ like they do not know what happens under the hood.  
I felt "MðŸ’²" had tried to convert JavaScript into C#, and it just happened that I tried to convert myself from the .NET stack to the NodeJS stack.  
  
But it's another story. Today, I can say **Microsoft did it pretty well**. Thanks.  
  
Thus, **I want to share with my type I use across projects** (I change it depending on needs).  
  
It helps me to convert a complex domain type into a payload type, a DTO I use in a communication layer for receiving commands or requests.  
  
```typescript
type ConvertToDto<Props> =
  Props extends Array<infer T>
    ? Array<ConvertToDto<T>>
    : {
        [Property in keyof Props]: Props[Property] extends Date
          ? string
          : Props[Property] extends boolean
            ? boolean
            : Props[Property] extends string
              ? string
              : Props[Property] extends number
                ? number
                : Props[Property] extends Array<infer R>
                  ? ConvertToDto<Array<R>>
                  : ConvertToDto<Props[Property]>
      }
```

And the usage:

```typescript
type TestBloodScheduleTime = {
  hour: Hour
  minutes: Minutes
  tz: TimeZoneOffset
}
type TestBloodScheduleTimeDto = ConvertToDto<TestBloodScheduleTime>

// The result is this ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
type TestBloodScheduleTimeDtoResult = {
  hour: number
  minutes: number
  tz: number
}
```
