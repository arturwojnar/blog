    <p>I'm Artur Wojnar and this is my blog I called <em>Know-How Code</em>.</p>

    <p>Why that name? I realised that the <em>know-how</em> is a toolset we build over years, and this is what can distinguish us from competitors. The <em>know-how</em> is the ability to solve non-trivial and complex issues by providing knowledge, experience and worked-out solutions, either third parties or your own.</p>

    <p>I have been working in the industry since 2011. Nowadays, I work as a hands-on Solutions Architect and consultant helping other teams. I collaboratively design products with clients. I treat the programming as a side effect of that design.</p>

    <p>My goal here, on this blog, is to embed this thought. I want to show you that <strong>most of the concepts in our industry can be simplified to risk and coupling management with a hefty dose of communication</strong>. I want to show you how the <strong>design phase is crucial</strong>, and if you don't think about the design, you will end up with ad-hoc architecture.</p>

      <p>You like <strong>Node.js</strong>. You like <strong>TypeScript</strong>.<br>
      But you <em>miss a lot</em> of things in this ecosystem. You miss a <em>chassis</em>.<br>
      <strong>Hermes PostgreSQL</strong> is part of the initiative that delivers to you a foundation of a <em>reliable system</em>.<br>
      It is a library, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not a framework</span>, which relies on PostgreSQL's Logical Replication feature. <em>It implements the Outbox pattern</em>. <em>You can span a database transaction over persisting an entity and publishing a message</em>.</p>
