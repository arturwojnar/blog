🎲🎲🎲

You never know who you'll meet on the other side. You don’t know the company’s mindset, the culture, or the internal politics. You’re jumping into the unknown — often into a chaotic organizational structure, at best. Most importantly, you might face someone who doesn’t necessarily wish you well. For me, recruitment processes often paint a rather sad picture of the industry’s state.

This text is a summary of my experiences and lessons learned — a collection of thoughts on how to handle interviews (and yourself) better.

## This Is My Herd 🐑

Recently, I completed a hiring process that turned out to be both professional and pleasant — a rare combination in my experience.

For context: I was applying for a **Solutions Architect / Tech Lead** role. I’ve been in the IT industry for over 14 years, working in various positions — Full-Stack Developer, Tech Lead, and Solutions Architect. I went through about 20 interviews over the course of a month and a half.

We’re social creatures. Biologically, we’re programmed to care about how others perceive us — especially groups we want to belong to (herd). Interviews trigger one of the strongest stressors there is: **social evaluation**. It’s a well-known stimulus that raises cortisol levels and heart rate. Studies confirm that both live and virtual evaluations reliably increase physiological stress ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1182959/full)).

I’m quite susceptible to stress and its physical symptoms. Somehow, interviews amplify those effects — which explains why I sometimes performed poorly despite knowing the answers. There were moments when I sounded dumb or blanked out — not because I didn’t know, but because I was too drained to respond effectively.

Most of my advice to my past self revolves around **managing stress**. But let’s make one thing clear:

## Stress Is Good for You — Don’t Try to Eliminate It! ⚡

A few years ago, the internet was full of clickbait titles like:

> “Stress has been linked to illnesses that include cancer, lung disease, fatal accidents, suicide, and cirrhosis of the liver.”  
> [Healthline article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-eight-ways-stress-harms-your-health-082713)

> “NEUROSCIENTIST: You Will NEVER Be Stressed Again.”  
> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_NO8e--2k)

> “How to Effectively Eliminate Stress from Your Life.”  
> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMHz6BNiEks)

Don’t read that 😄 Don’t watch it 😄

The truth is: only **chronic stress** leads to atrophy and damage. Stress response systems exist because they serve genuine **survival and adaptation functions**.

From [this study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5963997/?utm_source=chatgpt.com):

> Behavioral and physiological stress responses are *critical for survival* under adverse conditions. Rapid responses to acute stress *help organisms avoid actual harm* and cope with injuries if the threat cannot be avoided.  
>  
> However, these rapid responses become *harmful if repeated frequently* over long periods of time. Managing chronic stress requires different strategies — such as fear learning, prediction, and planning, which help avoid or prepare for future stressors.

Stress gives us power — to act, to fight, to adapt 💪  
Just not when it’s constant, repetitive, or prolonged. I used to feel drained before interviews because my stress started the night before and carried into the meeting itself. That is why, it happened that I felt completely out of energy during the interview.

What I needed to learn was **not to fight stress**, but to accept it. To acknowledge it as normal. To breathe through it — feel the tension and let it flow, not trap it in your chest.

It’s even harder if you’ve experienced childhood trauma. Trauma can detach you from your body — a condition known as *dissociation*. It’s linked to **impaired interoception** — a reduced ability to sense internal signals like heartbeat or breathing. [Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11150711/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) shows this disconnection plays a key role in emotional numbness and difficulty identifying feelings.

## Interviews Are an Unfriendly Mess 💀

Beware, traveler, on your journey through the interview wilderness.

Here are some behaviors and expectations I find toxic — a plague corroding modern recruitment processes:

⭕ **Camera off interviewers.** Seriously? How is that respectful? 😤  
It’s a conversation, not a voice-over test.

⭕ **Stone-faced recruiters.** You finish answering, and after a few seconds of silence they say, “_Is that all?_”  
Come on. I’ve been a recruiter too. A good screening should feel like a discussion — a back-and-forth exploration of knowledge, not an interrogation.

⭕ **Ghosting.** You have a great chat, everything seems fine… and then nothing. Or you hear, “_We’ll reach out soon_,” and they never do. 🕳️

⭕ **“Position closed” excuses.** “Priorities have changed.” Sure. Thanks for wasting both our time.

⭕ **Cliché-driven questions.** They focus on trivia that fades over time or doesn’t reflect real experience. For example:
   - “Describe the maturity levels of a REST API.”
   - “Explain the Node.js event loop in detail.”
   - "What are the AWS Well-Architected Framework's six pillars?"
   - …and other textbook nonsense that doesn’t define a professional’s worth.

⭕ **Superficial evaluation.** Too many interviews test shallow knowledge instead of real-world ability.

⭕ **Unrealistic expectations.** I’m not Google or ChatGPT 😅  
Once, a recruiter was shocked I couldn’t recall “Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)” by name — even though I knew *when* to use it.

⭕ **Ego-driven interviewers.** Some just want to show off or humiliate candidates.  
Like one who sneered, “_And this is REST API for you?_” — classy.

⭕ **Unprepared interviewers.** Sometimes they run out of questions halfway through, then later say, “_Your Node.js knowledge isn’t deep enough._” Well, maybe ask more?  
Same for frontend: I once didn’t know `useMemo`, and apparently that meant I “_can’t React._” Never mind my years working with jQuery, Angular, Ember, Vue, and React itself. 🙃

## People Often Don’t Know How to Recruit People 🤷‍♂️

It’s frustrating when a screening focuses solely on technical trivia instead of assessing a candidate’s real ability to **solve problems**.

The qualities I value most in my teams go far beyond remembering syntax or frameworks. I look for people who can **work independently**, think **analytically**, communicate well, and show a **self-driven attitude**. I value **curiosity**, **adaptability**, **pragmatism**, and the **eagerness to learn and grow**.

With today’s tools — especially **LLMs** — anyone can quickly verify information, explore new topics, or gain a basic understanding of unfamiliar areas. What truly matters is not _what_ you already know, but _how_ you approach learning and problem-solving. 🚀

## How to Manage Your Stress Before an Interview 🧘

Earlier, I quoted a paper that said that crucial is _prediction, and planning, which help avoid or prepare for future stressors_.

Here's a list of things you can do, which are in your control and power, that can help you with that:

🟢 **Prepare early.** It helps twice — you’ll be better informed *and* more confident. Use the job description to generate likely questions (AI tools can help).

🟢 **Research the company.** Know what they do, their values, and their culture.

🟢 **Check out the interviewers on LinkedIn.** A little insight can make small talk easier and reveal useful context.

🟢 **Craft a short, clear self-introduction.** Practice it until it flows naturally — this creates a strong first impression.

🟢 **Prepare stories.** Choose 1–2 recent or interesting projects and highlight the parts most relevant to the role.

🟢 **Own your failures.** Be ready to discuss one or two — focus on what you learned and how you improved.

🟢 **Practice out loud.** In front of a mirror or camera. Seeing yourself helps you adjust tone and confidence.

🟢 **Skip the coffee.** ☕ It may raise your blood pressure and make you jittery.

🟢 **Obvious but important:** Use the restroom before the interview 😄

---

## What to Do During the Interview 🎤

🟢 **Make eye contact.** Stay connected to the conversation — not just your thoughts.

🟢 **Speak slowly and clearly.** It helps you sound confident and gives your brain time to think.

🟢 **Pause intentionally.** Silence is okay. Use it to gather your thoughts.

🟢 **Paraphrase questions.** It ensures you understand them correctly — and shows active listening.

🟢 **Smile.** It softens tension on both sides 🙂

🟢 **Respectful disagreement is fine.** If an interviewer insists their opinion is the only right one, that’s a red flag 🚩.

---

## What to Do After the Interview 💌

🟢 You’ll never cover everything in one conversation.  
Send a short **follow-up email** summarizing key points, clarifying your answers, or adding something you forgot to mention. It shows professionalism and thoughtfulness.

## Outro 🌱

At some point, I stopped treating interviews as final judgments of my worth — and started seeing them as **random encounters** between two imperfect humans trying to figure each other out. Sometimes it clicks, sometimes it doesn’t, and that’s okay.

The truth is, an interview says as much about the **company** as it does about the **candidate**. If the process feels cold, disorganized, or disrespectful, it’s already a sign of what’s waiting inside. So take every experience as data, not as defeat. Learn, adapt, and move on stronger.

In the end, your career isn’t shaped by one conversation — it’s shaped by **how you show up again and again**, no matter how random the process seems. ✨
