I'm Artur Wojnar and this is my blog I called _Know-How Code_.

Why that name? I realised that the _know-how_ is a toolset we build over years, and this is what can distinguish us from competitors. The _know-how_ is the ability to solve non-trivial and complex issues by providing knowledge, experience and worked-out solutions, either third parties or your own.

I have been working in the industry since 2011. Nowadays, I work as a hands-on Solutions Architect and consultant helping other teams.
I collaboratively design products with clients. I treat the programming as a side effect of that design. 

My goal here, on this blog, is to embed this thought. I want to show you that **most of the concepts in our industry can be simplified to risk and coupling management with a hefty dose of communication**. I want to show you how the **design phase is crucial**, and if you don't think about the design, you will end up with ad-hoc architecture.
