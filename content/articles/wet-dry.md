_DRY_ (Don't Repeat Yourself)
_WET_ (Write Everything Twice)

_DRY_ has been an admirable rule, but the most significant application of it had meaning 2-3 decades ago when everybody had to care about the result size of the source code.

But still, it is a good practice in _SOME PLACES_. Like, you have a class and an implementation that repeats a few times in this class. This is a sign that you should apply the DRY.

Check out my simple _diagram_ what is the goal and importance od the WET.
