_The more I mature like a wine in a dark software development basement, the more I’m convinced that programming is not the most essential part of the development process, but the **collaboration** is._

Talking 💬<br />
Discussing 🗣️<br />
Exchanging thoughts 🤝<br />
Confronting ideas ⚔️<br />
Asking ❔<br />
Drinking coffee ☕<br />

> Actually, drinking coffee is the first and vital thing. Try to take away a coffee machine for your devs. Two days at most, and they will painfully transform into life-sucking energy vampires!

As a _Solutions Architect_, I have to **ask**, and I have to know. Thus, I implement all questions, heuristics and **collaborative tools** to get reliable information about domain processes and activities.

I encourage customers to get their products to the market for verification as soon as possible. I ask about the potential **future of the project’s life** to assess the likely direction of its **evolution**.

I ask how the customer thinks it’s expected to **measure** the project's or functionality’s success to make sure the customer feels about real users’ needs.

I do my best to understand the customers’ **domain** and guide them through software development’s meanders as, in fact, it is another similar system I’m working on.

_UX Designer_, as the role name suggests, is also about *design*.

A few years back (_Kyrie Eleison!_ How time goes fast!) I was astonished that the UXs I worked with for quite some time were using a bunch of _heuristics_ written down on flashcards. That began the slow process of understanding how close we have to work together. I was “_Balls! They ask the same questions!_”.

The truth is that a UX designer _must also understand the domain and the business reality_. For the same purpose - design.

What does the UX do? Examples from the top of the shelf:

➡️ Designing users' feelings into usable flows and UI

➡️ Shifting the focus on the product's competitive advantage

➡️ Investigating the customer's competition to determine where to emphasise the UI and the activities.

All of that contributes to the potential project’s success.

*Maturing in a barrel, I have understood that it is our job to contribute through collaboration and support.*

Below, you can see today’s fruit of my collaboration with [Natalia Milerska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-milerska). _We squeezed the maximum knowledge into 3 hours of workshops_😃
