If "_Hexagonal Architecture_" were changed to "_Hexagonal Implementation_", it would be much less confusing, IMHO.

The same goes for "_Vertical Slice Architecture_". Do you agree that "_Vertical Slice Implementation_" sounds better?

Other options:
➡️ Approach
➡️ Thinking
➡️ Structure

🤔 Ports&Adapters Approach
🤔 Hexagonal Structure
🤔 Vertical Slice Structure ❤️ 🩷 🧡 💛 💚 
🤔 Clean Thinking
🤔 Onion 🧅 Implementation
🤔 Onion 🧅 Structure

For now, for me, the Structure delivers the most meaning and what we get from those (so-called) "architectures".

Giving people hope they magically got an architecture because they implemented XYZ "_ARCHITECTURE_" is just cruel!

Go to the whiteboard, take a pen and design YOUR PROJECT's processes and functionalities. After that, make some bold decisions you can call Architecture.
